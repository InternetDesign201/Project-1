<h1> What is the internet, and why does my foot care about it? </h1>
<p> The internet is a worldwide system of computer networks - a network of networks which a user at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers). </p>

<h1>Whats the easiest way to connect to the internet? </h1>
<p> WIFI is offered almost everywhere, with it being a wireless networking technology that uses radio waves to provide wireless high-speed Internet and network connections to customers. Most homes, offices and buildings have WIFI modems helping users to connect their devices to the internet, with the router broadcasting the WiFi signal, allowing your devices to connect to each other and the Internet. <span> HOVER HERE to see what a modem looks like </span>

The cable which was completed in February 2001 has a current capacity of 5.4 Tbit/s. The network is 30,500 km in length, and has nine cable landing stations (including two in New Zealand).
